# Hackermanâ„¢
This program is sort of a joke between friends, and was originally written in Python by a buddy and turned into a "lets write this in more programming languages" type of challenge.

It should go without saying it isn't really trademarked nor do I care what usage comes out of this. I just wanted to write something in C as I haven't used it in a while.

## Platform Support
Currently, I have only built and developed this on a Windows box, eventually I may add more and make different builds.
